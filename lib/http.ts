/**
 * Tiny shared HTTP helpers for route handlers.
 *
 * Lives at lib/ because both /api/cashfree/create-order (to snapshot the
 * client IP into order_tags) and /api/cashfree/webhook (for diagnostic
 * logging) need the same logic. Keeping it here avoids drift between two
 * copy-pasted helpers.
 */

/**
 * Extracts the originating client IP from the standard proxy headers.
 * Returns "" only when EVERY known header is unset (in which case the
 * caller should skip the field rather than send blank to Meta CAPI).
 *
 * We try multiple headers because empirically (500+ paid leads) the
 * Pabbly `client_ip_address` column had been blank for in-app-browser
 * traffic. The original code only checked `x-forwarded-for` then
 * `x-real-ip`; we now also check Vercel's own forwarded header and the
 * Cloudflare connecting IP as additional safety nets. A one-line log
 * names the winning header so future debugging is trivial — keep this
 * log until we've confirmed IP populates on real production purchases.
 *
 * Header order (most-trusted first):
 *   1. x-forwarded-for          (standard; Vercel sets it)
 *   2. x-vercel-forwarded-for   (Vercel-specific mirror)
 *   3. x-real-ip                (older proxy convention)
 *   4. cf-connecting-ip         (defensive — repo doesn't sit behind CF today)
